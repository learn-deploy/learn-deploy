👋 Hi there! I'm SC, and @learn-deploy will serve as my portfolio page, showcasing the projects I've completed.
👀 My passion lies in acquiring knowledge and applying it to create practical solutions for myself and others.
🌱 Currently immersed in learning Python, I've developed several standalone apps to assist my department colleagues in their tasks.
💞️ I find true fulfillment in completing projects that genuinely benefit others.
🎯 Currently working towards mastering pygame hopefully create some fun to play mini games...
